//! Hierarchical commander + per-ant policy nets for the ant-brain Phase 2.
//!
//! - [`sizing`] — A1/A2/A3 dim presets shared by both tiers
//! - [`transformer`] — minimal transformer block primitive (multi-head attn +
//!   LayerNorm + FFN), used by both tier backbones
//! - [`commander::CommanderPolicy`] — outer-tick commander brain
//! - [`ant::AntPolicy`] — per-ant brain (shared instance per colony)
//! - [`actor_critic::HierarchicalActorCritic`] — composes both tiers
//!
//! The existing flat [`crate::policy::ActorCritic`] MLP is unchanged — it
//! remains the 47% Nash regression baseline.
